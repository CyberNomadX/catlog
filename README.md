# catlog

Multi-platform log analyzer for security incidents

---

## ðŸ§  Wishlist

This project is under active development. Hereâ€™s what I plan to include:

- [ ] **Linux Log Support**
  - Parse `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/secure`, and `/var/log/syslog`
  - Detect failed/successful logins, sudo events, and SSH access from new IPs

- [ ] **Windows Event Log Parsing**
  - Detect common security events (e.g., Event IDs 4624, 4625, 4672)
  - Use `pywin32` or WMI to pull events directly

- [ ] **Web Server Log Analysis**
  - Apache and Nginx log parsing
  - Detect common attack patterns (SQL injection, path traversal, bots)

- [ ] **Modular Design**
  - Individual parser modules for each log type
  - Unified CLI interface

- [ ] **Alerting & Reporting**
  - Print to terminal
  - Export to JSON/CSV
  - (Future) Discord webhooks or email notifications

- [ ] **Threat Intelligence Integration**
  - GeoIP lookup for IP addresses
  - Check IPs against AbuseIPDB

- [ ] **Tuning & Whitelisting**
  - Allow user-defined rules for known/allowed events
